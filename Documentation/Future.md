Payment Channels / Micropayments:

## Enable agents to open payment channels for low-fee, high-frequency transactions (e.g., agent-to-agent incentives, streaming payments).
### Multi-sig Wallets:
- Support for BSV multi-signature addresses for collaborative agent control or escrow scenarios.

### Pay-to-Write Data (P2WDB):
- Integrate with protocols that allow agents to pay to store/retrieve structured data on-chain (beyond OP_RETURN).

### Token Protocols (STAS, RUN, Sensible):
- Allow agents to issue, transfer, or manage tokens (NFTs, utility tokens) for reputation, access, or resource tracking.

### Merkle Proofs:
- Provide verifiable proofs of log inclusion or data integrity using Merkle trees.

### On-chain Oracles:
- Enable agents to fetch and verify external data (e.g., prices, events) from trusted on-chain oracles.

### Paymail Integration:
- Use Paymail for human-readable agent addresses and peer-to-peer communication.

### BSV Script/Smart Contracts:
- Allow agents to deploy or interact with custom BSV scripts for advanced logic (e.g., time locks, conditional payments).

### Data Indexing/Search:
- Integrate with on-chain data indexers (e.g., MatterCloud, WhatsOnChain) for fast log/history queries.

### Encrypted/Private Data Storage:
- Use protocols like sCrypt or encrypted OP_RETURN for storing private agent data with selective disclosure.
